            <span class="so">S</span>o, picture this: it’s 2014, and I’m just
            chilling, watching my brother play this super cool game on his
            phone. Every time he played, I’d be glued to his side, just staring
            at the screen. The sound effects, the screen shaking—it was all so
            epic. I didn’t even have a phone back then, so I was just living
            vicariously through him.

            Fast forward to 2015, and I finally get my hands on a phone—okay, it
            was almost falling apart, but hey, it worked! I started downloading
            games, figuring out how to install and play them, feeling like a
            tech genius. But Clash of Clans? That was the holy grail. I was
            dying to try it out.

        <div class="stroypart-3">
          <p class="part3">
            Then, my brother moves away to study other place and, guess what? He
            leaves his phone behind! Jackpot. The first thing I did was fire up
            Clash of Clans. I was dropped into this Town Hall 8 setup,
            completely clueless. I just started clicking random buttons, trying
            to figure out what the heck was going on. But somehow, I managed to
            get the hang of it.

        <div class="storypart-4">
          <p class="part4">
            I played nonstop, and after a few months, I even created another
            account and a clan, leveling it up to 12. I was obsessed—playing
            every day until 2018. Then, life (aka school and responsibilities)
            got in the way, and I had to step back. But I still hop on sometimes
            for a bit of nostalgia. Those were some good times, messing around
            with friends and just having a blast.
